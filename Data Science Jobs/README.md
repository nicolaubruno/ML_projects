# Data Science Jobs Vacancies

In this project, we explore **clustering** methods by using the [dataset](https://salaries.ai-jobs.net/download/) from the website [ai-jobs](https://ai-jobs.net/). The purpose is to cluster job vacancies in the Data Science field by experience levels. We shall explore the following methods:

- **Hierarchical Clustering** (hierarchical.ipynb)
- **Partitional Clustering** (partitional.ipynb)

We first perform a descriptive analysis on the data (descriptive-analysis.ipynb) in order to properly apply the clustering methods above.
